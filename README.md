# ScreenLocker #
A Small WPF app which overlays all your screens with a tranparant window.
When an unwanted user tries to do something, the app automaticly captures the intruder via the webcam and locks the workstation.

If you would like to iterate upon this project, feel free to do so. I look forward to see the iterations :)
